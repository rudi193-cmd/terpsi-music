"""Ablate each guard in the predicates and require the suite to notice.

Rule 19: *a guard that cannot be shown to fail has not been shown to work.*
`docs/survey/trigger_mutation_demo.py` establishes the method against a SQLite
schema; this applies it to the two predicates in `records/`.

**The load-bearing part is the applied-mutation check.** A `sed` expression that
no longer matches its target leaves the file unchanged, the suite green, and the
report reading `SURVIVES` — which is scout-13 row B exactly: *"a mutation which
kills no gate is a failed mutation, not a passing one."* This harness had that
defect on its first run, after a refactor moved a condition across two lines,
and reported a false survivor that was nearly written up as a finding.

So every mutation is verified to have changed the file before its result counts,
and a mutation that does not apply is an **error**, not a pass.
